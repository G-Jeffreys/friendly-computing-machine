                WordWise started as a simple idea: what if we could make professional-quality writing assistance 
                available to everyone, not just those with access to expensive tools or extensive training?

              <p className="mb-6">
                Our team of engineers, linguists, and designers came together to build something differentâ€”a platform 
                that doesn't just check your grammar, but actually helps you think through your ideas, find the right 
                tone, and present your thoughts with clarity and impact.
              </p>
