# SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) Dataset â€“ Licence Note

This project embeds the SCImago Journal Rank 2024 dataset in `lib/data/sjr_2024.json` (generated from the original CSV chunks located in `docs/scimagojr_chunks/`).

According to the SCImago website, the data is free for **non-commercial research and educational purposes**.  Redistribution or commercial exploitation may require explicit permission from SCImago/Elsevier.

> **TODO (before commercial launch):**
> 1. Review the current SCImago licence terms.
> 2. Contact SCImago or Elsevier Legal if commercial usage is planned.
> 3. Replace or augment SJR with a commercially-licensed metric if necessary.
