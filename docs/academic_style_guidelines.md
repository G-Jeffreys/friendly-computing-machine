# Academic Style Enhancement Guidelines

This guide outlines key principles for transforming general or informal text into a more scholarly and academic tone.

## Core Principles

1. **Avoid Vulgarity and Slang**  
   Eliminate crass language, slang, or casual expressions inappropriate for academic discourse.

2. **Use Formal, Precise Vocabulary**  
   Replace colloquial terms with formal, specific alternatives that align with disciplinary expectations.

3. **Maintain an Objective Tone**  
   Minimize emotional or subjective language. Focus on presenting information neutrally and dispassionately.

4. **Avoid Contractions**  
   Use full word forms (e.g., *“do not”* instead of *“don’t”*) to maintain formality.

5. **Use Third-Person Perspective**  
   Prefer third-person point of view unless first-person is common in the discipline (e.g., reflective essays or qualitative research).

6. **Avoid Idioms and Colloquialisms**  
   Replace figurative or cultural language with direct, literal expressions.

7. **Eliminate Redundancy and Wordiness**  
   Streamline sentences to improve clarity and reduce unnecessary repetition.

8. **Use Evidence-Based Assertions**  
   Support claims with data, citations, or logical reasoning rather than opinion or speculation.

9. **Avoid Rhetorical Questions**  
   Rephrase rhetorical devices as declarative statements to enhance clarity and formality.

10. **Incorporate Hedging Where Appropriate**  
    Use qualifiers like *“may,” “suggests,”* or *“appears to”* to express caution and avoid overgeneralization.

11. **Use Transitional and Logical Connectors**  
    Link ideas with words like *“however,” “therefore,” “in contrast,”* to guide the reader through your argument.

12. **Maintain Consistent Verb Tense**  
    Stick to a consistent tense appropriate to the discipline (usually past for results, present for general claims).

13. **Avoid Exaggeration and Hyperbole**  
    Remove intensifiers such as *“absolutely”* or *“the best”* unless empirically justified.

14. **Use Technical Terms Appropriately**  
    Apply domain-specific language accurately and only when necessary. Define terms when needed.

15. **Favor Clarity over Complexity**  
    Use precise sentence structures without sacrificing readability. Avoid convoluted phrasing.

16. **Disambiguate Pronoun References**  
    Replace unclear pronouns (e.g., *“this,” “it”*) with specific nouns when clarity demands it.

17. **Apply Parallel Structure in Lists and Series**  
    Ensure consistent grammatical structure across items in a list or series.

18. **Use Nominalization Judiciously**  
    Transform verbs into nouns (*“decide” → “decision”*) to focus on concepts, but avoid overuse that obscures clarity.

19. **Use Passive Voice Strategically**  
    Employ passive constructions when emphasizing action or result over the actor, but avoid excessive use.

20. **Avoid Personal Anecdotes**  
    Academic writing typically emphasizes evidence and analysis over personal experience, unless genre-appropriate.

21. **Ensure Proper Citation and Attribution**  
    Follow the relevant citation style guide and give credit where due.

22. **Adapt to Discipline-Specific Conventions**  
    Recognize and follow tone, structure, and language norms specific to each academic field.
